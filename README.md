# HANG-MAN-GAME-1
This C program implements a basic version of Hangman.
It selects a random word from a predefined list.
The user guesses letters of the word.
For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn.
If the hangman is fully drawn, the game ends and the user loses.
If the word is guessed correctly, the user wins.
The program uses a switch statement to print the hangman.
It prints the length of the word and its first and last letters.
The game continues until the word is guessed or the hangman is complete.
Finally, it prints the final word.
